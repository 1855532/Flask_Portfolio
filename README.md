## Overview of Code
Here is overview of files for the "Flask Portfolio":
* home.html: main page of flask website, bootstrap navbar, buttons with links to project scope and repl.it for each project, large image at top for aesthetics
* main.py: contains app routes which assign pathways; in this case, each webpage
* contents.html: contains basic information about projects included in the Flask website
* aboutus.html: use of Jinja and code for making navigation easier for user
    * ____.html: use of Jinja and embedding artifacts to show evidence of learning
* data.py: defined variables for each person's about us page
* aboutdn.html: consists of a navbar from bootstrap,welcoming, and nighthawk logo
    * dnclubs: embedded link to pdf of all clubs on campus, general description of variety of clubs
    * dnsports: embedded athletic calendar and guidebook, general description of timeline and rules to play
    * dnschedule: image of vl schedule, general description of vl circumstances
    * dnmap: image of map, general description of layout of school
    * NAV BAR FROM ABOUTDN PRESENT IN ALL DN FILES
* aboutsd.html: consists of navbar from bootstrap, welcoming, and instructions on how to use it
    * sdhistory.html: large picture of San Diego in the olden days, general history of San Diego
    * sdlandmarks.html: images of different landmarks, general description of each one
    * sdrestaurant.html: images of different restaurants, general description of each restaurant
    * sdtourist.html: images of different tourist spots, general descriptions of each
    * sdfeedback.html: feedback form for users to fill in basic personal information and submit any concerns
    * NAVBAR FROM ABOUTSD PRESENT IN ALL SD FILES
    
## Creativity and Intangibles 
The most unique feature of our project that should be highlighted is the About Us page. In this part of the project, we embedded pictures of ourselves and our achievements this trimester as well as descriptions of ourselves. This part of the Flask portfolio allows users to not only experience the website, but get a deeper look at the creators behind the project. It allows for users to put a face behind the names and also see what each creator contributed to the project.


## Mastery
Front end- HTML, Jinja, Templates
* HTML- HTML describes the structure of a webpage and its elements tell the browser (or website) how to display the content
* Jinja- Jinja is a template for Flask. It's a framework that allows you to write your web applications quickly and efficiently 

* Templates- An example of a template that we used in this project was bootstrap. 


Back end- Python, Routes, Passing data to HTML
* Python- Python is the language that we coded our Flask Project in
* Routes-  if we visit the particular URL mapped to some particular function, the output of that function is rendered on the browser's screen.
* Passing Data to HTML- When you use app routes to route information from one flie to another. In this project we passed data from the main.py file to the html files

Python command of fundamentals
* Loops- a loop is a programming structure that repeats a sequence of instructions until a specific condition is met. 
* Lists- A list is a number of items in an ordered or unordered structure. A list can be used for a number of things like storing items or deleting and adding items. 
* Dictionary- A dictionary has a set of keys and each key has a single associated value.
* Variables- variables are names used to hold one or more values. Instead of repeating these values in multiple places in your code, the variable holds the results of a calculation, database call, results of a database query, or other value.

## Tools
* IntelliJ- IntelliJ is the server which we downloaded to make coding moe efficient
* Github- Github is where we share code and access eachothers progress

# Instructions on Operating our Website
* Click the run button and click on the icon that will open the website in a new tab
* Next, Explore the navigation bar on which we have linked our journals, About Us page, and Contents of Our Website page.
* Next, Scroll to the bottom of our home page and click on the buttons underneath eack project. We have linked our project scope, repl.it link, and resources used for each project.

# Flask Portfolio
 This group website will be a reflection of our work over the trimester and it will contain all projects from this trimester. This website is meant to be a user friendly interface to our group's work in Computer Science. This is our first website that shows our progress throughout the year. It is similar to a Canvas page, which was our goal.


 
##  Usage of GitHub
We used GitHub to share our code and make adjustments without risking our main file. 
## Usage of IntelliJ
We initially downloaded intelliJ because Repl.it was causing problems. We downloaded and followed the instructions from Dane all week.
## Usage of Flasks and Routes
We used flask to make our website and had many app.routes to bring you to the new homepages

## Usage of Jinja
* template to create each about___.html page
