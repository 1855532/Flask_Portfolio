# Instructions on Operating our Website
* Click the run button and click on the icon that will open the website in a new tab
* Next, Explore the navigation bar on which we have linked our journals, About Us page, and Contents of Our Website page.
* Next, Scroll to the bottom of our home page and click on the buttons underneath eack project. We have linked our project scope, repl.it link, and resources used for each project.

# Flask Portfolio
 This group website will be a reflection of our work over the trimester and it will contain all projects from this trimester. This website is meant to be a user friendly interface to our group's work in Computer Science. This is our first website that shows our progress throughout the year. It is similar to a Canvas page, which was our goal.


# Purpose (AP CSP Flask Portfolio)
* Foundation in social media using Slack, Padlet and Zoom
* To organize information not only about the code, but also about the group. 
* Foundation in Python Code using GitHub
* Understanding how to create and organzie a website or canvas using Python and .html
* Create a clear and simple program that allows users to be able to experience and learn more about the group's projects 



## Project 
How We Implemented 4 C's in this Project: 
* Critical Thinking: When we got stuck on an error, we worked together to come up with unique solutions to fix these errors.
* Communication and Presentation: We had to present our flask website to other scrum groups and through this, we gained valuable insight on presentation. Whenever there was an issue, we made sure to communicate about the problems and collectively come up with ideas.
* Collaboration, CaTP 6:  We also divided our work equally so that we all learned something different and were able to explain our process to the rest of the team.
* Creativity and Intangibles: Through the process of creating code, we were able to discover new ideas that we did not know of before. The creative aspect of this project was what appealed most to us as were able to make our flask unique and different from other generic websites. It allowed for us to present our projects in the best way possible.



## Overview of Code
Here is overview of files for the "Flask Portfolio":
* Templates: consists of main.html, About Us sub menu, and the groupâ€™s journals. In the About us page, we had to code the images by defining the img src and filename. 
* Home.html: Purpose is to display the home page of the website as well as consisting of multiple sub menus and previous code. The code works through the navigation system that takes the user to the appropriate site (journal, rap name generator, or the project plan). The main.html also adjusts the text and size of certain parts of the site. A bootstrap template was used for the navbar within the project.
* About Us: Purpose is to display information about the group members and their contributions to the project. It uses image search and urls in order to display pictures of each group member. 
* Contents: Link in the navbar/website that brings the user to a page giving an overview of what is contained within our website.

# What We All Did
* Sophie: For this project, I was assigned to do the about us page. for the about us page, I did the layout and added the pictures. 
* Carter: I worked on the navbar and the app routes for the different links within our html project. At first this seemed like a tough task but with some help I was able to complete it.
* Mustafa: I finished a large majority of the README file and I filled out the aboutus section. I cleaned up the code, mainly in the templates. Finishing the README helped me better understand the code.
* Yazhisai: I experimented a lot with how to add backgrounds. At first, I thought we could use ascii art for the background. However, I realized that .html tries to conserve as much space as possible so this wasn't a viable option. I inserted an image at the top of the website that fitted the aesthetics of the website and sized it to fit correctly. I also added a file "Contents of Our Website" that outlines everything in the website for users.
* Aditi: I created the about us page and formatted it. Along with Carter, I created a Navbar and added all the links. I also formatted the home page and added all the links to the projects, repl.its and resources.
 
##  Usage of GitHub
We used GitHub to share our code and make adjustments without risking our main file. 
## Usage of IntelliJ
We initially downloaded intelliJ because Repl.it was causing problems. We downloaded and followed the instructions from Dane all week.
## Usage of Flasks and Routes
We used flask to make our website and had many app.routes to bring you to the new homepages
## Usage of Jinja
*create a navbar on the about us page so that when the user clicks on one of our names it takes us to the persons about us page rather than the groups.
